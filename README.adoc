This is a sample application that demonstrates how to allow having a unique session id based on a tenant id.
For example, a URL like this:

http://localhost:8080/example.com/

will have a different session id than a URL like this:

http://localhost:8080/example.org/

To observe this behavior visit:

http://localhost:8080/example.com/

Enter the following credentials:

* Username - rob
* Password - password

Observe the user name that is displayed as rob.

Now visit:

http://localhost:8080/example.org/

Enter the following credentials:

* Username - luke
* Password - password

Observe the user name that is displayed as luke.

Switch back to http://localhost:8080/example.com/ and observe that the user name is still displayed as rob.

Visit http://localhost:8080/spring.io/ and observe that authentication is still required.
